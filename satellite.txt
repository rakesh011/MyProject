I went everywhere for you
I even did my hair for you
I bought new underwear, they're blue
And I wore 'em just the other day
Love, you know I'll fight for you
I left on the porch light for you
Whether you are sweet or cruel
I'm gonna love you either way
Love, oh, love, I gotta tell you how I feel about you
'Cause I, oh, I can't go a minute without your love
Like a satellite, I'm in an orbit all the way around you
And I would fall out into the night
Can't go a minute without your love
Love, I got it bad for you
I saved the best I have for you
You sometimes make me sad and blue
Wouldn't have it any other way
